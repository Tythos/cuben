The “C/C++ Computational Numerics” library is an open-source (MIT license) set of methods and classes for solving both common and complex problems in numerical mathematics. It is designed and written in C/C++ (leveraging the Eigen library for vector and matrix support) for fast execution and near-universal platform support. Problems include multiple root-finding algorithms, numerous methods for solving systems of equations, classes for modeling different categories of numerical functions, ODE and PDE solvers, pseudo-random number generation, least-squares tools, and many others.
