Cuben: common c/c++ computational numerics (c-cubed n)
	use eigen for linear algebra data and algorithms
	define sub-modules by saur chapter
	each submnodule is a set of functions encapsulated in a static class
	each submodule is defined within the Cuben:: namespace
	solvers defined as objects to allow instances to set
		function handles
		tolerances
		max steps
	intended to be compiled into/used as static library + headers
